## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Information

When the user activates this skill, immediately ask:

```
I'll help you create an engaging LinkedIn post! Please provide:

1. **Topic**: What do you want to write about?
2. **Target Audience** (optional): Who are you trying to reach?
3. **Goal/CTA** (optional): What action do you want readers to take?
```

### Step 2: Research Phase

Once you have the topic, use the `search_web` tool to:

- Find latest trends and discussions on the topic
- Gather compelling statistics or data points
- Identify unique angles or perspectives
- Look for successful LinkedIn posts on similar topics

Research should focus on:
- **Relevance**: Current, timely information
- **Authority**: Credible sources and data
- **Engagement**: What resonates with LinkedIn audiences

### Step 3: Content Structure

Create the post following this proven structure:

**Hook (Line 1-2)**
- Start with a bold statement, question, or surprising fact
- Make it impossible to scroll past
- Examples: "I lost $50K before learning this...", "Everyone talks about AI. Nobody talks about this.", "Here's what 10 years in [industry] taught me:"

**Body (3-8 lines)**
- Use short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each)
- Add line breaks for visual breathing room
- Include specific examples, numbers, or stories
- Focus on ONE core message
- Use bullet points or numbered lists when appropriate

**Value Delivery**
- Provide actionable insights
- Share lessons learned
- Offer frameworks or tips
- Tell a relatable story with a lesson

**CTA (Final 1-2 lines)**
- Clear, specific action
- Examples: "What's your experience with [topic]?", "Follow for more insights on [topic]", "Download my free guide (link in comments)", "Repost if you agree ♻️"

### Step 4: Click-Worthy Elements

Ensure the post includes at least 2-3 of these:

- **Curiosity Gap**: Tease information without revealing everything
- **Social Proof**: "10,000 people did this...", "After 5 years of..."
- **Controversy**: Challenge common beliefs (respectfully)
- **Emotion**: Inspire, motivate, or create empathy
- **Specificity**: Use exact numbers, not vague terms
- **Pattern Interrupts**: Unusual formatting or unexpected statements

### Step 5: CTA Optimization

Make the CTA:
- **Action-oriented**: Use verbs (comment, share, follow, download)
- **Low-friction**: Easy to do (one click/comment)
- **Value-driven**: Clear benefit for taking action
- **Authentic**: Matches your voice and post content

### Formatting Guidelines

- **Length**: 150-300 words (sweet spot for engagement)
- **Line breaks**: Every 1-2 sentences for mobile readability
- **Emojis**: Use sparingly (1-3 max) for visual interest
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end
- **Mentions**: Tag relevant people/companies when appropriate

### Example Output Format

Present the final post like this:

```
=== LINKEDIN POST ===

[Hook line that grabs attention]

[Body paragraph with value]

[Supporting point or story]

[Key insight or takeaway]

[Clear CTA]

---

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't bury the lead (hook must be first)
- Avoid jargon or corporate speak
- Don't make it too long (over 400 words)
- Skip generic advice everyone knows
- Don't use more than 5 hashtags
- Avoid clickbait that doesn't deliver
- Don't forget the CTA
- Skip walls of text without breaks

## Resources

### Hook Templates

Use these as starting points:

1. **The Mistake**: "I made a $X mistake so you don't have to..."
2. **The Contrarian**: "Everyone says X. Here's why they're wrong..."
3. **The List**: "X things I wish I knew about [topic]..."
4. **The Story**: "3 years ago, I was [situation]. Today, [transformation]..."
5. **The Question**: "Why do [surprising observation]?"
6. **The Data**: "X% of people don't know this about [topic]..."

### CTA Templates

1. **Engagement**: "What's your take on this? Drop a comment 👇"
2. **Growth**: "Follow me for daily insights on [topic]"
3. **Community**: "Tag someone who needs to see this"
4. **Amplification**: "Repost to help others ♻️"
5. **Conversion**: "Want to learn more? Link in comments 👇"

### Engagement Boosters

- Post between 7-9 AM or 12-1 PM on weekdays
- Respond to comments within the first hour
- Ask questions to encourage comments
- Use carousel posts for longer content
- Tag relevant people (sparingly)
- Share personal experiences and lessons

## Advanced Tips

### For Maximum Engagement

1. **The First Hour is Critical**: Engage with commenters immediately
2. **Algorithm Favors Dwell Time**: Make people stop and read
3. **Comments > Likes**: Ask questions to drive comments
4. **Native Content Wins**: Don't just share links, add context
5. **Consistency Matters**: Post regularly (3-5x per week)

### A/B Testing Ideas

Test different approaches:
- Question hooks vs. statement hooks
- Story-based vs. data-based posts
- Short (100 words) vs. medium (250 words)
- Different CTA types
- With/without emojis
- Different posting times

## Error Handling

If research yields limited results:
- Pivot to a related angle with more data
- Focus on personal experience/insights
- Ask user for specific sources or examples they want included

If the topic is too broad:
- Ask user to narrow down the specific angle
- Suggest 2-3 focused directions based on research

If CTA is unclear:
- Default to engagement CTA (asking for comments/opinions)
- Suggest options based on user's typical goals

**Note**: Always prioritize authenticity and value. The best LinkedIn posts feel personal and provide genuine insights, not just viral tricks.
