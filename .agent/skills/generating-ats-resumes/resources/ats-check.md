# ATS Glitch Checklist

Run this check on the generated resume before presenting it to the user.

- [ ] **No Columns**: Use a single-column layout only.
- [ ] **Standard Headings**: Ensure headings use common names (Experience, Education, Skills).
- [ ] **Text only**: No images, logos, icons, or progress bars for skills.
- [ ] **Clean Links**: Links should be readable text (e.g., https://linkedin.com/in/user), not hidden behind words if possible.
- [ ] **Bullet Points**: Use standard round bullets (●). Avoid fancy arrows or symbols.
- [ ] **Date Consistency**: Dates follow a consistent format throughout.
- [ ] **Contact Info**: Ensure Phone, Email, and Location are at the top and clearly labeled.
- [ ] **Section Order**: Summary -> Skills -> Experience -> Education (General standard).
