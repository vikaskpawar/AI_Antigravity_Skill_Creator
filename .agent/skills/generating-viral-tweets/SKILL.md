# Generating Viral Tweets

## When to use this skill
- Creating engaging posts for X (Twitter) based on a specific topic.
- Transforming complex thoughts into short, punchy, "click-worthy" statements.
- Aiming for virality through professional, high-value content.
- Ensuring posts are professional and non-offensive (following "LinkedIn-style" quality standards).

## Workflow

1. **Topic Intake**
   - [ ] Ask the user for the core topic or raw thought.
   - [ ] Identify the "Angle" (e.g., Hot take, Listicle, Story, Question).

2. **Hook Selection**
   - [ ] Choose a template that builds curiosity or creates a pattern interrupt.
   - [ ] Ensure the first sentence makes the reader stop scrolling.

3. **Content Drafting**
   - [ ] Keep the body text under 240 characters.
   - [ ] Use line breaks for readability.
   - [ ] Integrate 1-2 relevant hashtags.

4. **Safety & Quality Check**
   - [ ] Verify content is non-offensive and professionally grounded.
   - [ ] Check for "engagement traps" (questions, prompts for replies).
   - [ ] Ensure the content provides actual value, not just empty clickbait.

## Instructions

### 1. The "Click-Worthy" Hook
The first line determines success on X. Use these proven professional styles:
- **The Contrarian**: "Everyone thinks X. Actually, the best in the world do Y."
- **The Result**: "I spent 100 hours studying [Topic]. Here are the 3 things that actually matter."
- **The Comparison**: "X is the past. Y is the future. Here is why."
- **The Question**: "Why is everyone still doing [Topic] the old way?"

### 2. Conciseness & Structure
- **Character Limit**: Aim for 200-240 characters max (leaving room for tags/reposts).
- **Line Breaks**: Use them liberally. A tweet should look "airy."
- **Emojis**: Use 1-2 to draw the eye, but avoid "emoji-spam."
- **Hashtags**: Use exactly 2. One broad (e.g., #AI), one specific (e.g., #Python).

### 3. Professional Standards (LinkedIn-Style)
Even on X, keep it "LinkedIn-clean":
- **No Offensive Content**: No polarizing politics, personal attacks, or sensitive taboos.
- **Value-First**: Every tweet should teach something, inspire someone, or provoke healthy debate.
- **Fact-Based**: Deep research (if enabled by tools) should back up bold claims.

### 4. Viral Templates

## Error Handling
- **Topic too dry**: If the topic is boring, pivot to a "lesson learned" or "mistake I made" angle to add human element.
- **Topic too offensive**: If the user requests content that violates safety or professional standards, provide a sanitized version that hits the same impact without the risk.
- **Too wordy**: If the draft is over 280 characters, systematically remove adverbs and filler words (e.g., "very", "basically", "literally").
